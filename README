This sample will be used to help demonstrate integration between GitHub, 
IBM WebSphere Application Server, Docker and Amazon AWS. The project builds
a sample 'hello world' .war file, and packages it into a .zip file along with
a Dockerfile. 

This .zip file can then be deployed to Amazon Elasticbeanstalk. 

Travis integration is provided via .travis.yml. 

So: 
Register for Amazon AWS. 
Set up aws command line. 
git clone this project
Install a Java compiler - 'dnf install java-1.?.0-openjdk-devel' on Fedora 
mvn clean install

This builds target/upload-1.0.zip

This zip file will be deployed as a Docker container to Amazon Elastic
Beanstalk by Travis. It's also possible to deploy it manually:

sudo dnf install jq

As per https://dzone.com/articles/how-deploy-docker-application 
copy 
https://github.com/mvanholsteijn/sample_nodejs_cf/blob/master/deploy-to-aws.sh

chmod +x ./deploy-to-aws.sh
./deploy_to_aws.sh app-name target/upload-1.0.zip

This will take several minutes. On completion it will print the public URL that
you can access - go to this URL to see the Liberty landing page, or /test
to see the output from src/main/java/test/TestServlet.java
